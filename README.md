🗭 Kelp Island: A Multiplayer Governance Sandbox Built with the Logos Stack

🔍 Overview

Kelp Island is a privacy-first, multiplayer sandbox game where players build floating societies using SeaBricks, then simulate how their governance choices play out in realistic 3D environments.

It feels like Minecraft meets SimCity, but with real governance logic, collective resource allocation, and simulation-driven outcomes. Inspired by digital worlds like Second Life, but grounded in coordination infrastructure like Waku, Nomos, and Codex, Kelp Island helps communities prototype, stress-test, and iterate on real-world parallel societies.

The project began with a seasteading community in San Francisco, in collaboration with the global Seasteading Society. From this emerged the idea of SeaBricks—modular, kelp-based building blocks. These bricks, both in-game and real-world, are designed to model future stable societies built on regenerative infrastructure and decentralized economics.

Kelp Island is a speedrun simulator for building network states—offering communities a chance to explore architectural and governance structures before they deploy them in real life.

🧱 MVP Game Loop

1. Onboarding

Members join a round by staking into the Kelp Island Co-op

SeaBricks are allocated as a one-time or cyclical resource



2. Build & Propose

In a shared 3D world (Minecraft-style fork), players physically build their environment

Proposals are made for projects (e.g. energy grid, kelp farms, education pods)

SeaBricks are allocated to build, vote, or stake on proposals



3. Deliberation & Decision

Governance rounds run on a time cycle using Nomos and Codex

Players move SeaBricks using conviction logic to signal support

Discussions and votes happen over Waku-enabled comms



4. Simulation

The world is frozen and simulated over days, months, or years

Simulation considers constraints (energy, food, cohesion, disaster response)

Results are published to Codex and visualized in-world or as a generated animation


Note: The simulation’s outcomes are not random. They reflect the rules and assumptions encoded in the scenario. Part of the game is experimenting with these inputs to surface which frameworks produce resilient, equitable, or surprising results.


5. Reward & Iterate

Participants who backed successful strategies receive bonus SeaBricks

Bricks may be restaked or carried to future rounds

Communities may fork, merge, or evolve based on learnings

🛠️ Components Breakdown

🧱 Minecraft/Game Layer (MVP)

Fork of Minecraft or Minetest to support modular brick placement

Bricks behave differently based on how they’re grouped (e.g., kelp farm, utility block, solar node)

Export world state to simulation backend


🔐 Identity & Onboarding

Nomos keypair creation

Waku invitation flow (with Nomos-authenticated handshake)

Wallet interface for SeaBrick allocation and tracking


🧮 Voting & Governance

Codex-based proposal system

SeaBrick staking to signal support

Nomos conviction voting logic and round timers


🌀 Simulation Engine

Agent-based or constraint-based backend (Python or Godot logic tree)

Scenario definitions per Hode (e.g., oil rig, kelp island chain)

Simulation runs triggered post-decision lock


🎞 Outcome & Rewards

Results published via Codex and optionally visualized with animation layer

Bonuses returned to members with high-impact proposals or accurate forecasting



---

🧪 First Use Case: "Kelp Rig v0.1"

Scenario: Offshore oil rig retrofitted into a regenerative kelp-powered community

Environment: real-world geolocation (e.g. off Norway coast)

Challenges: power budget, food needs, environmental risk, trade

Players: 15-20 members with roles and shared SeaBrick pool

Goal: create a functioning self-sufficient community using SeaBricks

💡 Background & Origin

Kelp Island draws inspiration from the Seasteading movement and early experiments in floating infrastructure, especially those near San Francisco. The idea of using kelp—one of the fastest carbon-sequestering plants on Earth—as a construction material was born out of this lineage.

SeaBricks are real-world, modular, kelp-based building blocks under active development. They are designed to eventually serve as both physical infrastructure and a backing asset for a fully decentralized, stable, and low-carbon currency. Kelp Island exists to model how that currency, and the societies that might use it, could be prototyped digitally first.

🎯 Who This Is For

Kelp Island is designed for:

Builder communities creating intentional settlements or co-ops

Network state organizers

Regenerative designers and system architects

Game developers and simulation modelers

Off-grid coordination experimenters


It is first and foremost a game. But it’s a game designed for serious play—an imagination engine for builders of real-world parallel societies.


---

📍 Regional Hodes (Logos Cells)

Kelp Island is organized around regional hodes, which function as independent Logos-aligned cells exploring specific geographic or bioregional use cases. Each hode can be run independently, fork shared models, and customize their simulation logic based on local goals.

Examples:

Kelp Island: Norway — Simulates life on a refurbished Shell oil rig in the North Sea

Kelp Island: Brazil — Explores sea-based society design off the Brazilian coast


Each hode can adapt shared SeaBrick mechanics and reuse simulation components to fit their own imagined or real locations. Hodes can coordinate with each other through Waku and Codex, creating a distributed network of regenerative society prototypes.
